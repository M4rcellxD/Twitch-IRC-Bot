This little project was created in Go.  It originally was from someone else but I forgot the link.  I now modified it so you can use it for Twitch.TV.  I have put in a few commands already.  It uses no external packages.  The coding is questionable but it works.  :)

How to use:
git clone https://github.com/Vaultpls/Twitch-IRC-Bot
or Download ZIP -> On the right sidebar

Create twitch_pass and insert the oauth from
http://twitchapps.com/tmi/

Then either "go run bot.go" or "go build bot.go"
